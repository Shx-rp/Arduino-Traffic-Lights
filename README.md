# Arduino-Traffic-Lights
## Info
This was a school project issued to us.
## How it Works
The project has 2 buttons, one for turning the circuit on and another one for emergency shutdown in case of any error.There are 4 leds on this project, the blue led indicates the power status of the circuit, if the led is on then the circuit is active. The other 3 represent the colors of the traffic lights and behave as such. They have different durations for on and off.

This project makes use of an Algorithmic State Machine, also refered to as ASM
